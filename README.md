# Asset Bubbles and Reinforcement Learning
Python implementation of "Monetary Policy and Asset Bubbles".


### Algorithm Implementation

- `dl_bubbledetection.ipynb`: Implements LSTM networks to study asset bubbles. First, simulates data to generate bubbles. Second, trains networks on the simulated data. Validates it following the 80-20 rule. Additionally can test for bubbles in S&P 500 component data.
